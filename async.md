Sure the code does work, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't do what you expect it to do. It just fires off multiple asynchronous calls, but the printFiles function does immediately return after that.

If you want to read the files in sequence, you cannot use forEach indeed. Just use a modern for â€¦ of loop instead, in which await will work as expected:

```javascript
async function printFiles () {
  const files = await getFilePaths();

  for (let file of files) {
    const contents = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf8');
    console.log(contents);
  }
}
```

If you want to read the files in parallel, you cannot use forEach indeed. Each of the the async callback function calls does return a promise, but you're throwing them away instead of awaiting them. Just use map instead, and you can await the array of promises that you'll get with Promise.all:


```javascript
async function printFiles () {
  const files = await getFilePaths();

  await Promise.all(files.map(async (file) => {
    const contents = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf8')
    console.log(contents)
  })); 
 }
 ```
